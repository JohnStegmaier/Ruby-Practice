# Ruby-Practice
A repository where I'll commit practice code for the Udemy course "[The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013z63@3gP2PmFwdjXpb6PUxV-CWjtO_uGu62tFK-ETd6TVkk4LmAw79Ilq6Jp7ucY0ToeelQ==/)" by [Rob Percival](https://www.udemy.com/user/robpercival/) and [Mashrur Hossain](https://www.udemy.com/user/mashrurhossain/)  

This repository will likely just contain the basics of the language and the Ruby on Rails assignments will be given their own repositories separate from this one.
